## üìà Sales Trends
### Overall Sales Performance

- Rapid growth followed by contraction: Sales more than doubled from 2019 to 2020 (+161%), but then declined by 51% over the next two years, highlighting a short-lived boom likely tied to pandemic-specific conditions.
- Despite the strong boost in 2020, the company did not sustain growth in 2021

- Loyalty member status is correctly recorded at the time of each purchase.
- Marketing channel attribution is based on last-touch or final-click data unless otherwise specified.
- External factors (e.g., COVID-19, inflation, supply chain issues) may have impacted customer behavior and sales but are not modeled directly.
- Profitability was not assessed due to lack of cost or margin data; analysis is based on revenue only.
- Customer-level segmentation (e.g., demographics, behavior) was not possible due to limited customer data.
